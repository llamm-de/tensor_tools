A modern Fortran library for tensor calculus.

## Dependencies
This project has the following optional dependencies:

* [**pFUnit**](https://github.com/Goddard-Fortran-Ecosystem/pFUnit) - A unit testing framework for Fortran
* [**Doxygen**](https://www.doxygen.nl/) - Automated documentation tool

These dependencies are enabled by default. If you do not wish to use them.
As described below, you can turn them off individually by passing the appropiate flags to CMake. Keep in mind, that you won't be able to generate unit tests and/or a documentation without those libraries.
